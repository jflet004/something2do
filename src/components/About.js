      <p>My name is Jose Fletes and I am currently a Software Engineering bootcamp student at <a href='https://flatironschool.com' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flatiron School</a></p>
      <p>This website was created as part of my final React project for the bootcamp's Phase 2</p><br/>
      <p>My inspiration for this project was the amount of times I was bored during the pandemic. Shout out to the people running <a href="http://www.boredapi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BoredAPI</a> and making it possible to access their database with tons of activity ideas</p><br/>
